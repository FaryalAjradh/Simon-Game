# Simon-Game
!!!This project works only on desktop.
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill. 
I made this game in the form of a webpage using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. 
The buttons create a series of tones and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. 
Once the user fails, the game is over.
